## Gameplay
The player is the small blue circle and begins by rotating around one of the larger red circles. Upon tapping the screen, the player is launched along the tangent line to that circle in an attempt to land from circle to circle, avoiding the boundaries of the screen. The player gets a point for landing on another circle, and gets additional points for any circles skipped along the way.

## Platforms
Tangents is built using a cross-platfrom framework, and targets iOS, Android, and Desktop devices using OpenGL (including Windows, MacOS, and Linux). However, the game is intended for and works best on mobile devices.
  
## Distribution
Coming soon! The game itself has been completed and tested on my iPhone 11, OnePlus 6, and Windows laptop. A release `.apk` can be generated in the near future for Android, but the iOS version is blocked until I make an Apple Developer Account.
  
## Assets
The font in the game is [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat), usable under an Open Font License. All other assets were created by me.
  
## Code
The visual studio `.sln` file is also provided in the repo. The entire project can be opened in Visual Studio (`2022 Community Edition` was used to develop this game, while `Visual Studio For Mac` used to build the iOS version).
